Welcome to YourNewModel by Jadio!
We're thrilled to have you explore "YourNewModel," a foundational project for designing your own Base Large Language Model from scratch. This guide will help you get started by showing you how to navigate the project files, understand the code, and explore the accompanying documentation.

1. Viewing the Project Files
Your project is structured to provide a clear overview of the LLM development process. You'll find a mix of documentation files (HTML), Python scripts, and configuration files.

HTML Files: These files form the core of your comprehensive guide. They are designed to be viewed in a web browser and explain each step of LLM design, from data collection to deployment.

Python (.py) Files: These are where the practical implementation of your LLM components would reside. You'll find scripts for data handling, model architecture, training loops, and more.

JSON (.json) and YAML (.yaml) Files: These files are typically used for configuration, storing hyperparameters, dataset metadata, or model settings.

We encourage you to browse through the project directory to familiarize yourself with the overall structure.

2. Reading the Docstrings
To truly understand the Python code within this project, pay close attention to the docstrings. Docstrings are multi-line strings used to document Python modules, functions, classes, and methods. They provide essential information about what each piece of code does, its parameters, and what it returns.

Reading docstrings will give you immediate insights into the functionality and purpose of various Python components, making it easier to follow the logic and contribute to the code.

3. Checking Out the HTML Files (Your Comprehensive Guide)
The HTML files are your primary resource for learning about LLM design. They are laid out as a multi-page guide, covering the theoretical and practical aspects.

Start with densemodel.html: This is the introduction page to the entire guide.

Navigate through the Table of Contents: Each HTML page includes a "Table of Contents" on the left sidebar, allowing you to jump between different sections of the guide.

Use the "Previous Page" and "Next Page" buttons: These buttons at the top and bottom of each content section will help you move sequentially through the guide.

By exploring these HTML documents, you'll gain a deep understanding of how to design your own base LLM.

Utility Scripts
As you work with your project, you might find two utility scripts helpful:

rename_project.py: Use this script to globally rename "YourNewModel" to a name of your choice across all relevant project files (.html, .py, .json, .yaml).

remove_docstrings.py: This script can help you clean up your Python files by removing docstrings, which might be useful for specific deployment or distribution scenarios.

Refer to the Mini-README: Project Utility Scripts Canvas for detailed instructions on how to use these scripts.

Enjoy your journey into the world of Large Language Models!
